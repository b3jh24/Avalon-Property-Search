# Avalon-Property-Search
Repo containing Python scripts that can find home owner information for a given home in Avalon

Windowed application that allows me to enter in addresses from homes in Avalon and find out information about that home. The Spreadsheet script
can take the output file of the original search script and create a spreadsheet with the residents permanent addresses. This data can be used
with Google maps via BatchGeo.com to plot the locations of these homes.
